# Website for the famous DJ Timmy Turner
Quick website for DJ Timmy Turner

### Environment Set Up
Though it isn't strictly necessary to run the application, I prefer to create a fresh virtual environment for every new project, to ensure everything runs as expected.
To do that, I utilize pyenv-virtualenv, which I download through Homebrew. The instructions below do not assume you are in a clean environment but will override your package dependencies (if there are conflicts in your environment). If you would like help setting up a virtual environment, let me know and I'd be happy to help!

### Necessary Steps Before Running the Project
1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Install the required packages recursively with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` depending on your local setup.
### Running the Website Locally
To run this website locally, use the command `python runserver.py` and then open your [localhost](http://localhost). Note that you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` depending on your local setup.
